# TDOA
Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) plays an extremely important role in the current  military warfare because of their low cost, zero casualties, flexibility and sustainable  operations.  The  passive  TDOA  positioning  system  requires  only  a  single  receiving  channel for each observation station, which can minimize the load requirements of the  positioning  system,  and  has  high  positioning  accuracy.  It  is  widely  used  in  military  fields such as electronic countermeasures. In this thesis, the problem of time difference  location of radar signals based on UAVs is studied.
